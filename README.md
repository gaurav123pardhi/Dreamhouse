Project topic: Dreamhouse: Real‑Estate CRM on Salesforce (Apex + LWC)

Problem statement:

A real‑estate brokerage needs a lightweight CRM to list properties, manage brokers and buyer inquiries, and streamline property discovery without heavy custom tooling. The solution should enable brokers to create and manage property listings, allow buyers/agents to search and filter properties, and provide managers with visibility through reports and dashboards. The app must include a clear data model, admin automation for routine updates, developer extensions for bespoke logic, and optional integration hooks for future external services.
